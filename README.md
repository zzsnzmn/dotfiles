# zzsnzmn's elegant dotfiles repo
A lot of the configs here are heavily based on (and sometimes ganked entirely) from [mathiasbynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/).

Assuming you cloned or downloaded the dotfiles properly, you can install them with the following command.
```
source ./bootstrap.sh
```

If you're using OS X and would like to install some useful things you can download brew [here](http://brew.sh/). Once installed run...
```
brew bundle ~/Brewfile
```
