If it's the first install on a new computer, you'll have to make sure you install powerline as an editable python package via:
```
pip install -e ~/bin/powerline
```

If you're using OS X and would like to install some useful things you can download brew [here](http://brew.sh/). Once installed run...
```
brew bundle ~/Brewfile
